# Sprints, releases and components: design

**Status:** proposal, for review · **Date:** 2026-10-30 · **Starts from:** atm 0.23.0 · **IDs:** SR-

atm moves from **phases** to **sprints and releases**: a sprint is a batch of work that agents do and a person
plans and closes; a release is what ships together. With them come **components** (areas of the product), **review
modes and states**, a **`with: user`** field for work done together, a **resolution** for finished work and two
**relations**. Phases are migrated to sprints and removed.

This design turns [the tracker fields research](tracker-fields-research.md) into requirements. Its section 8 holds
the decisions this rests on (*Decided*, 2026-10-30); this document doesn't repeat the reasoning, only what follows
from it. Requirement IDs are `SR-<section>.<n>`; priorities as in [v4](v4/README.md) (P1 needed, P2 wanted).

## 1. Decisions

From the research's section 8, and the ones this design adds (marked *new*):

1. **Sprint and release, optionally linked:** a sprint delivers to at most one release; a release takes one or more
   sprints. A task's release defaults to its sprint's (research Q1).
2. **One active sprint** at a time; sprints are `planned`, `active` or `closed`. The **backlog** is the tasks with no
   sprint (Q4, 8.1).
3. **The loop works a selection** — the active sprint, a named sprint, a list of tasks, all tasks or the backlog —
   and stops when the selection is done; `--phase` becomes `--sprint` (Q2, Q3).
4. **Sprint planning and closing are sessions with the user**, each a skill; moving tasks between sprints and the
   backlog is an atm command (8.1). The end-of-sprint review of `batch` tasks is a step of closing, not a task
   (review question 3).
5. **Dates are optional:** a sprint's `start` and `end` are set when it starts and closes; `due` is planned (Q4).
6. **Release IDs are any string** (Q5). A release is `released` when its PR merges (`/atm:push`, `atm merged`).
7. **Components** carry paths and a default review mode (Q6).
8. **Review modes** `blocker`, `async`, `batch`, `none`, and **review states** `waiting`, `changes_requested`,
   `approved` inside the review kind (research 5.5, 5.6); dependents of a task in review wait (Q9); a change asked
   for at the end-of-sprint review is a follow-up task (Q10); rework goes back to the same agent first (Q11).
9. **`with: user`** marks work done together; unattended loops skip it (Q7).
10. **Phases are migrated to sprints and removed** (Q8).
11. *New:* **`atm migrate` does the migration** automatically, as it does every other one: phases become sprints the
    first time a new atm runs in a project, staged in git, not committed. The dashboard reads phases as sprints for
    projects not yet migrated (SR-8.3). (Review question 1.)
12. *New:* **Sprints are named, and the name is the ID.** When none is given, atm generates one: a historical
    person's name not yet used in the project ("Ada Lovelace"), or, if the project prefers, the time it was created
    ("May 12-10:38pm", with "-2", "-3" for more in the same minute). (Review question 2.)
13. *New:* **`meta.sprints`, `meta.releases` and `meta.components` merge item by item**, by ID, like tasks (SR-2.4).
14. *New:* **Epics (`parent`) stay out**, as the research proposed: a follow-up document.
15. *New:* **How many sprints a project has, and what goes in each, is decided in planning**, never fixed in
    advance; this design's own work is ordered by dependencies (section 9), not pre-planned into sprints.
    (Review question 4.)

## 2. Data model

Extends [v4/data-model.md](v4/data-model.md); everything optional, files without it behave as today minus phases
(SR-8).

### 2.1 `meta`

```json

```

| Field | Item fields | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `sprints` | `id` (its name), `goal`, `state`, `release`, `start`, `end`, `due`, `report` | in order: the order they are planned and worked in |
| `releases` | `id`, `name`, `state`, `target`, `pr`, `released_at` | in order |
| `components` | `id`, `label`, `paths`, `review` | `paths` are globs, matched against tasks' `files` |
| `review` | — | the project's default review mode; `none` when absent (today's behaviour) |
| `sprint_names` | — | how atm names a sprint created without a name: `people` (default) or `time` (SR-2.9) |

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-2.1 | P1 | Sprint states are `planned`, `active`, `closed`; at most one sprint is `active`. `start` is set when a sprint becomes active, `end` when it closes; `due` (a date) is optional and only planned. A closed sprint keeps its `report`: the tasks done in it, the tasks carried over and where to (SR-4.3). |
| SR-2.2 | P1 | Release states are `planned`, `released`, `archived`. A release's `pr` and `released_at` are set by `atm merged` when the PR that contains its tasks merges (SR-6.2), or by hand. `name` is optional (the ID is any string, Q5). |
| SR-2.3 | P1 | atm-cli validates the new lists with `meta` (DM-2.2): unique IDs, known states, one active sprint, a sprint's `release` and a component's `review` known. A sprint's ID is its name: up to 48 characters, no leading or trailing space, unique in the project (compared case-insensitively). Release and component IDs are any string of letters, digits, `.`, `-` and `_`. |
| SR-2.4 | P1 | The merge driver merges `sprints`, `releases` and `components` item by item, by ID, like tasks: an item changed on one side takes that side; changed on both, a sprint's or release's further state wins (planned < active < closed; planned < released < archived), else ours, reported as a conflict; two different items added on both sides with the same ID are a conflict to resolve by hand (a name can't be renumbered the way a task ID is). Other `meta` keys merge as today. |
| SR-2.9 | P1 | **Sprint names.** `atm sprints add` takes a name; without one, atm generates it by `meta.sprint_names`: `people` picks a historical person's name not yet used in the project from a list shipped with atm (scientists, writers, explorers, artists: a few hundred, so a project doesn't run out), `time` uses the creation time in the project's local time, `May 12-10:38pm`, with `-2`, `-3` … for more in the same minute. A sprint's name never changes once tasks refer to it (`atm sprints rename` would rewrite every task's `sprint` and `sprint_history` in both files under the lock: P2). |

### 2.2 Task fields

| Field | Set by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `sprint` | `add`, `edit`, `move`, sprint close | a sprint ID; absent: the backlog |
| `sprint_history` | atm-cli, when `sprint` changes | `[{sprint, from, to}]`: each sprint the task was in and when; merged like `blocks` |
| `release` | `add`, `edit` | a release ID; when absent, the sprint's release applies |
| `components` | `add`, `edit`, suggested from `files` | component IDs |
| `review` | `add`, `edit` | `blocker`, `async`, `batch`, `none`; when absent, the first component's, then `meta.review` |
| `review_state` | `review`, `approve`, `request-changes` | in the review kind only: `waiting`, `changes_requested`, `approved` |
| `sprint_review` | `done` on a `batch` task; closing the sprint | `pending` until the end-of-sprint review, then `reviewed` (SR-4.4) |
| `with` | `add`, `edit` | `user`: the work is done with the user present |
| `resolution` | `done`, `skip` | done and skipped kinds only: `done`, `wont_do`, `duplicate`, `obsolete` |
| `related` | `add`, `edit` | task IDs, a link both ways that doesn't block |
| `duplicate_of` | `skip --duplicate-of` | a task ID, with the `duplicate` resolution |

`phase` is removed by the migration (SR-8); `sprint_history` keeps where a task was planned.

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-2.5 | P1 | A task is in at most one sprint (`sprint`), or in the backlog. Every change of `sprint` (by `add`, `edit`, `move`, closing a sprint) ends the open `sprint_history` entry and starts a new one, so a closed sprint's report and "added mid-sprint" (SR-7.2) can be derived. |
| SR-2.6 | P1 | A task's effective release is its `release`, else its sprint's `release`; its effective review mode is its `review`, else its first component's that has one, else `meta.review`, else `none`. Readers use these, never the raw fields alone. |
| SR-2.7 | P2 | `atm add` and `atm edit --add-file` suggest components from `files` and the components' `paths` (printed, not set, unless `--components auto`); `atm check` warns about a task whose files match no component when the project has components. |
| SR-2.8 | P1 | `related` is stored on one side and shown on both; `duplicate_of` requires the `duplicate` resolution and an existing task (in either file). Neither affects readiness: only `dependencies` do (DM-3.1). |

## 3. atm-cli

New and changed commands. Every command takes `--json`, as today.

### 3.1 Sprints and the backlog

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `atm sprints [--all]` | the sprints in order: ID, name, state, release, due, task counts by kind; closed ones only with `--all` |
| `atm sprints add ["<name>"] [--goal T] [--release R] [--due DATE] [--after S]` | a planned sprint, last or after `S`; without a name, atm generates one (SR-2.9) |
| `atm sprints edit <S> [--name] [--goal] [--release] [--due]` | changes a sprint |
| `atm sprints start <S>` | makes it active; refused while another is active; sets `start` |
| `atm sprints close <S> [--carry-to <S2> \| --carry-to new [--name "…"] \| --carry-to backlog]` | closes it (SR-4.3) |
| `atm move <id>... --to <S> \| next \| active \| backlog` | moves tasks: into a sprint, the sprint after their current one, the active sprint, or the backlog |
| `atm backlog` | the tasks with no sprint, as `atm list` prints them |

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-3.1 | P1 | `atm move` refuses a task that is claimed (active kind) or finished (done or skipped kind): work in progress or done stays where it happened. `--to next` with no planned sprint after the current one is refused with a message naming `atm sprints add`. |
| SR-3.2 | P1 | `atm list`, `atm status`, `atm archive` and `atm next` take `--sprint <S>` (repeatable), `--backlog`, `--release <R>` and `--component <C>`; `--phase` is removed (SR-8). `atm status` shows the active sprint (goal, due, progress) first. |
| SR-3.3 | P1 | `atm add` takes `--sprint`, `--release`, `--component` (repeatable), `--review`, `--with user`, `--related`; `atm edit` the same plus their removal. A task added without `--sprint` goes to the backlog. |

### 3.2 What `atm next` takes (the selection)

The loop's scope is a **selection**; `atm next` takes the same options the loop does (SR-5.1):

| Selection | `atm next …` | Takes |
|---|---|---|
| the active sprint *(default when the project has sprints)* | — | the active sprint's ready tasks |
| a sprint | `--sprint S` | that sprint's ready tasks, whatever its state but closed |
| a list | `--tasks T-1,T-5` | those tasks, in that order when ready |
| all | `--all` | every ready task: the active sprint first, then planned sprints in order, then the backlog |
| the backlog | `--backlog` | the backlog's ready tasks |

Within a selection: tasks with `review_state` `changes_requested` or `approved` first (SR-6.4), then priority rank,
then ID, as today without the phase.

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-3.4 | P1 | With no selection option, a project with an active sprint selects it; a project with sprints but none active selects nothing, and the reason says so ("no active sprint: plan one with /atm:plan-sprint, or run with --all"); a project without sprints selects all tasks, as today. |
| SR-3.5 | P1 | `atm next --claim` skips tasks with `with: user` unless `--with-user` is given (SR-6.6). `atm start <id>` never skips them: naming a task is choosing it. |
| SR-3.6 | P1 | When a selection has nothing ready, the reason distinguishes: all done (the selection is finished), the rest waiting (on dependencies, review, a decision, the user), or empty. The loop stops on any of them (SR-5.2). |

### 3.3 Releases

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `atm releases [--all]` | the releases: ID, state, target, task counts by kind and stage (done, in PR, merged) |
| `atm releases add <R> [--name] [--target DATE] [--pr N]` | a planned release; with `--pr N`, every task whose `pr` is `N` gets `release: R` (for releases recovered from PRs, SR-8.2) |
| `atm releases edit <R> …`, `atm releases archive <R>` | changes or archives it |
| `atm releases notes <R>` | a Markdown draft of the release's changes from its tasks: grouped by type, each with its ID, name and outcome note; for the CHANGELOG and WHATS-NEW entries a person writes |

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-3.7 | P1 | `atm merged --pr N` (exists) also marks released the release whose tasks are all in PR `N` and merged, setting its `pr` and `released_at`; a release with tasks outside the PR stays planned and `atm merged` says which. |

### 3.4 Reviews, resolution, relations

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `atm review <id> [--note]` *(exists)* | in review, `review_state: waiting` |
| `atm approve <id> [--note]` | `review_state: approved`: back to an agent to finish what the task asks after approval |
| `atm request-changes <id> --reason T` | `review_state: changes_requested`, with a `rejection` note; stays in the review kind |
| `atm reject <id> --reason T` *(exists)* | kept: back to `todo`, for work that should start over |
| `atm done <id> [--resolution R]` | from active, or from review only when approved or by the reviewer (as today); resolution `done` by default |
| `atm skip <id> --reason T [--resolution wont_do\|obsolete\|duplicate] [--duplicate-of ID]` | as today, with a resolution (`wont_do` by default) |

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-3.8 | P1 | The review mode decides how a task ends (research 5.5): `atm done` on an active task whose mode is `blocker` or `async` is refused ("this task is reviewed: `atm review`"); for `batch` it is done, with a `review` note and `sprint_review: pending`, for the end-of-sprint review (SR-4.4); for `none` it is done. A person (not an agent) may always `atm done` a task. |
| SR-3.9 | P1 | A task with `changes_requested` or `approved` is work for an agent: `atm next --claim` takes it before new tasks, preferring its `started_by` for one lease length after the review ended, then any agent (Q11). Taking it moves it to the active kind; its `reviews` history records the round and its outcome. |

## 4. The sprint workflow

Research 8.1, as atm commands and skills.

### 4.1 Planning: `/atm:plan-sprint` (new skill)

A session with the user, in the conversation:

1. Show the state: the active sprint (if any) and what's left in it, the planned sprints, the backlog grouped by
   label and component, and tasks carried over from the last closed sprint (its `report`).
2. Agree on the sprint: new or a planned one, its name, goal, release and optional due date (`atm sprints add` /
   `edit`).
3. Go through candidates with the user: pull from the backlog (`atm move … --to S`), push back what doesn't fit
   (`--to next` or `backlog`), and check dependencies (a task whose dependencies are in a later sprint or the
   backlog is flagged).
4. Start it when the user says so (`atm sprints start`), and say how to run it (`/atm:loop-tasks`).

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-4.1 | P1 | `/atm:plan-sprint` never starts a sprint, moves a task or sets a date without the user agreeing in the session; it proposes, the user decides. It may create follow-up tasks only through `/atm:create-tasks` (S-3.4). |
| SR-4.2 | P2 | It shows, for the proposed sprint, its size against the last closed sprints (tasks, and measured working time per task from DM-4.1), so the user sees whether it's bigger than usual. |

### 4.2 Working a sprint

`/atm:loop-tasks` with the selection (SR-5.1). Tasks can still be moved at any time (`atm move`); a task pulled into
the active sprint mid-sprint is "added" in its report (SR-7.2).

### 4.3 Closing: `/atm:close-sprint` (new skill) and `atm sprints close`

1. **Review** what the sprint got done, with the user: the done tasks with their outcome notes, and first the `batch`
   tasks waiting for this review (`sprint_review: pending`, SR-4.4), each with its `review` note. Small fixes can be
   made live; what needs more becomes a follow-up task.
2. **Decide the rest**: each unfinished task is carried to the next sprint (default), moved to the backlog, or
   skipped with a resolution.
3. **Choose where carried tasks go**: the next planned sprint; one of several, chosen by the user; or a new one,
   created now.
4. **Close**: `atm sprints close S --carry-to …`; offer `/atm:plan-sprint` for the next one.

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-4.3 | P1 | `atm sprints close` refuses while a task in the sprint is claimed (active kind) or a `batch` task in it is still `sprint_review: pending` (`--reviewed` marks them all reviewed, for `/atm:close-sprint` once the review step is done); otherwise it moves every task not done or skipped to `--carry-to` (a sprint, `new`, or `backlog`; required when such tasks exist), keeping their status (a task in review stays in review), sets `state: closed`, `end`, and `report: {done, carried, added, to}`. |
| SR-4.4 | P1 | **The end-of-sprint review is a step of `/atm:close-sprint`, not a task** (review question 3): a `batch` task, when done, gets `sprint_review: pending` and its `review` note, and dependents go on (research 5.5). The sprint's pending reviews show in `atm status`, `atm sprints` and the dashboard's sprint header (SR-7.2), so they are visible as waiting on the user. Closing reviews them first; what the user wants changed becomes follow-up tasks in the next sprint, `related` to the original, which stays done (Q10). |
| SR-4.5 | P1 | Carried tasks keep their `sprint_history`, so a task carried three times shows it (the dashboard flags tasks carried twice or more). |

## 5. Skills

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-5.1 | P1 | `/atm:loop-tasks` takes a selection: `--sprint S` (replaces `--phase`), `--tasks T-1,T-5`, `--all`, `--backlog`; none: the active sprint, or all tasks in a project without sprints (SR-3.4). `--type` and the other flags stay. `/atm:do-task <id>` is unchanged; without an ID it takes the next task of the default selection. |
| SR-5.2 | P1 | The loop stops when its selection has nothing ready and says why (SR-3.6): for a finished sprint, what it got done and what's left, and that `/atm:close-sprint` closes it (Q2). `--continue` goes on to the next planned sprint once the active one is finished: it never closes a sprint itself. |
| SR-5.3 | P1 | `--with-user` lets the loop take `with: user` tasks (the user is watching); without it they are skipped and listed at the end ("waiting for you: T-…"). |
| SR-5.4 | P1 | `/atm:do-task` and the loop end a task by its review mode (SR-3.8): `blocker` waits for the review in the session (asks the user now, or stops an unattended loop); `async` goes on; `batch` and `none` are done. The do-task text that reads "a review is asked for" from descriptions is replaced by the mode. |
| SR-5.5 | P1 | `/atm:create-tasks` proposes a sprint (the active one, a planned one, a new one) or the backlog for new tasks, and components and a review mode for each, instead of phases. |
| SR-5.6 | P1 | `/atm:push` records releases with merges (SR-3.7) and, in a release-branch project, suggests the branch name from the active sprint's release (`dev/<release>`), never renaming an existing branch. |

## 6. Reviews and working together

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-6.1 | P1 | Review states live in the review kind: `review_state` is `waiting` after `atm review`, `changes_requested` after `atm request-changes`, `approved` after `atm approve`; it is removed when the task leaves the review kind. A project's own review statuses keep working: the state is a field beside them. |
| SR-6.2 | P1 | Dependents of a task in the review kind wait, whatever its state (Q9): only done meets a dependency (DM-3.1). |
| SR-6.3 | P1 | `async` tasks: the agent or loop goes on with other ready tasks after `atm review`; `blocker` tasks: it takes no other task until the review ends (SR-5.4). |
| SR-6.4 | P1 | `changes_requested` and `approved` tasks are taken back by agents first (SR-3.9). The /atm:do-task workaround that records an approval as a rejection (`reject --reason 'Approved; …'` then `start`) is replaced by `atm approve`. |
| SR-6.5 | P2 | The `interactive` label is migrated: tasks with it get `with: user` (the label stays, as a label). `/atm:create-tasks` sets `with: user` for work the user asked to do together. |
| SR-6.6 | P1 | `with: user` tasks show as "needs you" on the dashboard (with In Review and Blocked on the user, D-3), and `atm next --claim` skips them in unattended loops (SR-3.5). |

## 7. Dashboard

Phases leave the dashboard; sprints take their place, and releases and components are new.

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-7.1 | P1 | **Filters:** a Sprint group (the active sprint first, then planned, the backlog, then closed ones folded like finished phases are today), Release and Component groups; the Phase group is removed. |
| SR-7.2 | P1 | **A sprint header** above the Kanban, List and Graph when a single sprint is selected (the active one by default): name, goal, due ("due in 3 days", overdue in red), release, progress (done of total) and, from `sprint_history`, how many tasks were added mid-sprint and carried in, and how many `batch` tasks wait for the end-of-sprint review. |
| SR-7.3 | P1 | **Kanban:** "Group by sprint" replaces "Group by phase" (one lane per sprint, the backlog last). Cards show their sprint only when more than one is shown. |
| SR-7.4 | P1 | **Progress tab:** the phase table becomes a sprint table (closed sprints with their report: done, carried, added; the active and planned ones with progress); the burndown's "phase" range becomes the sprint's (start to end, or to due), and the forecast is per sprint. |
| SR-7.5 | P1 | **A release view** (Progress tab, or the Project tab): each release with its sprints, task counts by stage (done, in PR, merged), its PR and state, and the notes draft (SR-3.3) to copy. |
| SR-7.6 | P1 | **Detail panel:** sprint (with its history when carried), release, components, review mode and state, `with: user`, resolution, related tasks and duplicates, each linked. |
| SR-7.7 | P2 | **The overview and project cards:** the active sprint's name, progress and due replace the current phase. |
| SR-7.8 | P1 | The dashboard reads unmigrated projects' phases as sprints (SR-8.3), so a dashboard serving several projects shows them all the same way. |

## 8. Migrating phases

### 8.1 The migration

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-8.1 | P1 | `atm migrate` turns phases into sprints in both `tasks.json` and the archive, once (a project with `meta.sprints` is migrated): each phase that has tasks or a name becomes a sprint named after it (its name, or "Phase n" for an unnamed one; a name already taken gets " (phase n)"), in phase order; a task's `phase` becomes its `sprint` and a `sprint_history` entry (from its `created_at`), and `phase` and `meta.phases` are removed. Sprints whose tasks are all finished are `closed` (`start`: their earliest `started_at`, `end`: their latest finish time, a report without carried tasks); the others are `planned`. None is made active: the migration prints the planned sprints and says to start one with `/atm:plan-sprint` (SR-3.4). The changes are staged, not committed, as other migrations are. |
| SR-8.2 | P2 | Releases can't be derived from phases in general. `atm releases add <R> --pr N` assigns a release to every task in PR `N` (SR-3.3); for this repository, the CHANGELOG's versions and the PRs on tasks give the list, done once by hand (SR-9). |
| SR-8.3 | P1 | Until a project is migrated, the dashboard shows its phases as read-only sprints named after them (SR-7.8), and atm-cli commands keep working on it: there is no write guard, since every skill runs `atm migrate` first, which converts it (settled with Hakan on 2026-10-30, T-292: a guard would cost rewriting the phase fixtures of atm-cli's tests for little). Removing phase support from atm-cli (`--phase`, `atm phases`, the phase in `add`, `list`, `status` and `atm serve`'s overview summary) is its own task, after the dashboard reads sprints everywhere. |
| SR-8.4 | P1 | **Older atm versions** (≤ 0.23) would read a migrated file as tasks without phases: `atm next` would order by priority alone and `--phase` would select nothing, but nothing would be lost or rewritten. The changelog says to update every agent's plugin before the first run of the new version in a shared project, as for the archive (DM-6.2). |
| SR-8.5 | P1 | The merge driver handles a branch migrated on one side and not on the other: a task with `phase` on the unmigrated side and `sprint` on the migrated side keeps `sprint`; `meta.phases` is dropped when the merged `meta` has `sprints`. The next `atm migrate` finishes any task that still has a `phase`. |

### 8.2 Compatibility

| ID | P | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| SR-8.6 | P1 | A project that never uses sprints, releases or components works as today without phases: `atm next` takes all tasks by priority and ID, the dashboard shows no sprint header or groups. A migrated project with one planned sprint per former phase is the usual starting point; it can also move everything open to the backlog (`atm move … --to backlog`) and plan afresh. |

## 9. Implementation order

How this design gets built in this repository. It is an order of work by dependency, not a plan of sprints: how
many sprints that takes, and what goes in each, is decided in planning (decision 15). Until sprints exist, the tasks
are created in **phase 27**, the only grouping atm has today; the migration turns it into a sprint like every other
phase, and from then on `/atm:plan-sprint` moves the remaining tasks into sprints as it goes.

| Step | Builds | Needs | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Sprints in atm-cli** | the data model and merge for sprints, sprint names, `atm sprints`, `atm move`, `atm backlog`, selections in `atm next`, `--sprint` everywhere; the migration in `atm migrate`, with the dashboard reading phases as sprints so nothing breaks before step 2 | — | SR-2.1, 2.3–2.6, 2.9, 3.1–3.6, 8.1, 8.3–8.6 |
| **2. Sprints on the dashboard** | Sprint filters, the sprint header, Group by sprint, the sprint table, burndown and forecast per sprint; phases removed from the dashboard | 1 | SR-7.1–7.4, 7.6–7.8 |
| **3. The sprint workflow** | `/atm:plan-sprint`, `/atm:close-sprint` (with the end-of-sprint review step), `atm sprints close` with carry-over and report; the loop's selections and stopping; create-tasks proposing sprints | 1 | SR-4.1–4.3, 4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.5 |
| **4. Releases** | `meta.releases`, `atm releases` (with notes), `atm merged` releasing, `/atm:push` suggesting branches, the release view; this repository's releases recovered from its PRs | 1 (dashboard part: 2) | SR-2.2, 3.7, 5.6, 7.5, 8.2 |
| **5. Reviews and working together** | components, review modes and states, `approve` and `request-changes`, `sprint_review` and its step in closing, `with: user`, rework to the same agent; the `interactive` label migrated | 3 | SR-2.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.4, 5.3, 5.4, 6.1–6.6 |
| **6. Resolution and relations** | `resolution`, `related`, `duplicate_of`, their CLI options and dashboard display | 1 | SR-2.8, §3.4 (`skip`, `done`) |

Steps 2, 3, 4 and 6 can go in parallel once step 1 is in; step 5 needs the closing workflow of step 3.

**This repository's migration** happens when step 1 ships: phases 0 to 27 become sprints named after them (closed
where finished, planned otherwise), and the first `/atm:plan-sprint` (step 3) chooses what goes in the first sprint
from them, including the open tasks of phase 24 (T-277, T-279) and the CompMD work (phase 26). The tasks for all six
steps are created with `/atm:create-tasks` once this design is approved, with their dependencies as in the table.

**Docs:** the v4 documents are updated where they define phases ([data model](v4/data-model.md) §2, the
[atm-cli](v4/atm-cli.md) commands, the [skills](v4/skills-and-workflows.md)), `plugin/CLAUDE.md`, Help and the
README, in the sprint that changes each.

**Security** ([security-architecture.md](security-architecture.md)): the new fields agents act on (`with`,
`review`, `review_state`, `sprint_review`) and the new skills change what agents do from task data, so steps 3 and 5
run the agent sandbox and update that document; no new HTTP route or CI permission.

## 10. Questions for review

Settled with Hakan on 2026-10-30:

1. **Automatic migration:** yes, in `atm migrate` (decision 11).
2. **Sprint IDs:** names, generated when none is given: a historical person's name, or the creation time (decision
   12, SR-2.9).
3. **The end-of-sprint review:** a step of `/atm:close-sprint`, not a task (decision 4, SR-4.4).
4. **The number of sprints:** project-dependent and decided in planning; this design's own work is an implementation
   order (decision 15, section 9).
