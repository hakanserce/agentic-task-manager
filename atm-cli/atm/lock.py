"""The lock directory.

A lock is a directory: mkdir succeeds for exactly one process, on every OS and file system. The holder writes
owner.json inside it and removes the directory when done. A crashed holder leaves the directory behind, so a waiter
breaks the lock when its owner is provably gone (same host, pid not running) or it is older than LOCK_STALE. See
docs/parallel-agents-design.md, section 4.
