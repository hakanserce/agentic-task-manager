  Start, stop or check the local server for the task dashboard, one for all your projects. Use when the user says

  server", or "is the dashboard running".

# Serve the Dashboard

You start, stop or report the background HTTP server that shows the task dashboard. There is **one server for all of
the user's projects**: it shows this project, the others atm has run in, and an overview of all of them. The plugin's
`atm` command does the work; you run it and relay what it prints. Never read or edit `tasks.json` or
`tasks-archive.json` directly: `atm status`, `atm show` and `atm list` answer questions about the tasks.

## Step 1: Parse arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain:

| Argument | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `start` (default) | Start the server, or report the one already running, and give this project's address |
| `stop` | Stop the server (for all projects) |
| `status` | Say whether it runs, and where |
| `--open` | With `start`: also open the dashboard in the default browser |
| `--all` | With `start`: give the overview of all projects instead of this project |
| `--port N` | With `start`: try port N first (default 8765; the next free port is used if it's busy) |
| `--dir PATH` | Show the project at PATH instead of the current one |

## Step 2: Run the helper

From the project root, run:

```bash
atm serve <action> [--open] [--all] [--port N] [--dir PATH]
```

(`atm` is atm-cli, the plugin's command; its `bin/` is on your PATH while the plugin is enabled. If the shell says
`atm: command not found`, write `"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../bin/atm"` instead.)

The helper:
- moves an old `docs/tasks.json` (or `tasks.json` in the root) into `.agentic-task-manager/` first, and cleans up
  after older versions (a project's own copy of the dashboard and its own server);
- adds the project to the dashboard's list of projects (`atm projects` shows them);
- serves the dashboard on `localhost` in a background process that keeps running after this session ends. The
  dashboard comes with the plugin, so updating the plugin updates it: the server restarts itself on the new version.

If it exits with code 127, Python 3.9 or newer is not installed: atm needs it, so tell the user to install it.
For any other error, show its message.

## Step 3: Report

Relay the helper's output. After a successful `start`, add:

> **Dashboard:** <the URL it printed>
>
> It shows all your projects: switch with the arrow next to the title, or open **All projects** for the overview.
> It refreshes itself every 5 seconds, so you can watch an agent work through tasks with `/atm:loop-tasks`.
> The server keeps running in the background; stop it with `/atm:serve stop`.

If the output included a line about moving `tasks.json`, also say the move is staged (not committed) and that it
should be committed.

Then run `atm repository`. If it says there is no address yet, add one line: commits and pull requests on the
dashboard become links once the repository's address is set, with `atm repository set <url>` (or ask me to set it).
